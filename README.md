# Financial_Fraud_Detection
In the realm of financial institutions, the detection of fraudulent transactions stands as a
paramount challenge amidst the vast expanse of daily transactional data. Leveraging the
efficiency and versatility of SQL (Structured Query Language), this project proposes a
methodology to pre-process and analyse transactional data swiftly and effectively. SQL
serves as a robust tool for filtering transactions, creating pertinent features, and aggregating
data, thus laying the groundwork for subsequent modelling endeavours.
By harnessing SQL, the project aims to unearth anomalous patterns indicative of potential
fraud, such as the occurrence of multiple high-value transactions from a singular account
within a condensed timeframe. Once the dataset is meticulously prepared, the integration of
machine learning algorithms further fortifies the fraud detection framework. These
algorithms, when trained on the prepared dataset, enable the classification of transactions
into two categories: legitimate or fraudulent.
The symbiotic relationship between SQL and machine learning not only enhances the
precision and efficiency of fraud detection but also yields substantial cost savings for
financial institutions, thereby safeguarding assets and bolstering trust within the financial
ecosystem
